Ernest Fokoue is a professor of statistics at Rochester Institute of Technology in the School of Mathematical Sciences. His research interests include statistical learning technology, bayesian statistics, theoretical statistics, statistical machine learning, ring theory, computational statistics and epistemology. He leads the statistical machine learning and data science lab as well as the data science research group, which spearheads the creation and development of state of the art and avant-garde algorithms, learning machines and methods for knowledge discovery.

Ernest Fokoue is currently exploring the interface of differential equations and empirical processes, with the finality of reconciling first principles traditional mathematical modeling with empirical data driven approach of statistics and statistical machine learning.
